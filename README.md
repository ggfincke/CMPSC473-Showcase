# CMPSC 473 Class Project Showcase

This repository contains a curated collection of projects completed for **CMPSC 473: Operating Systems** at Penn State (Fall 2023). The projects reflected what we learned in the class, where we explored key OS concepts such as memory management, threading, and system calls. Every project was completed with my good friend Avanish Grampurohit.
