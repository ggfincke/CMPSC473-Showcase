# Checkpoint 1 Work
Implemented mm_init, mm_malloc, mm_free and mm_realloc.
mm_init, and mm_realloc was implemented by Avanish Grampurohit
mm_malloc and mm_free was implemented by Garrett Fincke
Debugging was done by both on random functions.

# Final Submission Work

We attempted to create this with a segmented list implementation, but could not reach a substantially higher throughput than what we got using the implicit one. Functions were edited/implemented sporadically by Garrett and Avanish, debugging was also done similarly. We did a lot of this project together on the Westgate machines, so the commit history isn't exactly representative of who did what.
